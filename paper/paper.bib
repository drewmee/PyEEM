abstract = {Synthetic data is an increasingly popular tool for training deep learning models, especially in computer vision but also in other areas. In this work, we attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of the various directions in the development and application of synthetic data. First, we discuss synthetic datasets for basic computer vision problems, both low-level (e.g., optical flow estimation) and high-level (e.g., semantic segmentation), synthetic environments and datasets for outdoor and urban scenes (autonomous driving), indoor scenes (indoor navigation), aerial navigation, simulation environments for robotics, applications of synthetic data outside computer vision (in neural programming, bioinformatics, NLP, and more); we also survey the work on improving synthetic data development and alternative ways to produce it such as GANs. Second, we discuss in detail the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation problem that inevitably arises in applications of synthetic data, including synthetic-to-real refinement with GAN-based models and domain adaptation at the feature/model level without explicit data transformations. Third, we turn to privacy-related applications of synthetic data and review the work on generating synthetic datasets with differential privacy guarantees. We conclude by highlighting the most promising directions for further work in synthetic data studies.},

abstract = {Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements are useful in fields such as food science, analytical chemistry, biochemistry and environmental science. EEMs contain information which can be modeled using the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model but the data analysis is often complicated due to both Rayleigh and Raman scattering. There are several established ways to deal with scattering effects. However, all of these methods have associated problems. This paper develops a new method for handling scattering using interpolation in the areas affected by first- and second-order Rayleigh and Raman scatter in such a way that the interfering signal is, at best, removed. The suggested method is fast and requires no additional input other than specifying the scattering region. The results of the proposed method were compared with those obtained from common alternative approaches used for preprocessing fluorescence data before analysis with PARAFAC and were shown to be equally good for various types of EEM data. The main advantage of the interpolation method is in its lack of additional metaparameters, its algorithmic speed and subsequent speed-up of PARAFAC modeling. It also allows for using EEM data in software not able to handle missing data. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper explains the multi-way decomposition method PARAFAC and its use in chemometrics. PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally sealing and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two- way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.},

abstract = {The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is suppressed by a phenomenon of self-quenching known as the inner filter effect (IFE). Despite widespread use of fluorescence to characterize DOM in surface waters, the advantages and constraints of IFE correction are poorly defined. We assessed the effectiveness of a commonly used absorbance-based approach (ABA), and a recently proposed controlled dilution approach (CDA) to correct for IFE. Linearity between corrected fluorescence and total absorbance (ATotal; the sum of absorbance at excitation and emission wavelengths) across the full excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in dilution series of four samples indicated both ABA and CDA were effective to an absorbance of at least 1.5 in a 1 cm cell, regardless of wavelength positioning. In regions of the EEMs where signal to background noise (S/N) was low, CDA correction resulted in more variability than ABA correction. From the ABA algorithm, the onset of significant IFE (>5%) occurs when absorbance exceeds 0.042. In these cases, IFE correction is required, which was the case for the vast majority (97%) of lakes in a nationwide survey (n= 554). For highly absorbing samples, undesirably large dilution factors would be necessary to reduce absorbance below 0.042. For rare EEMs with ATotal > 1.5 (3.0% of the lakes in the Swedish survey), a 2-fold dilution is recommended followed by ABA or CDA correction. This study shows that for the vast majority of natural DOM samples the most commonly applied ABA algorithm provides adequate correction without prior dilution. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {The inhalation of particulate matter (PM) is a significant health risk associated with reduced life expectancy due to increased cardio-pulmonary disease and exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and pneumonia. PM originates from natural and anthropogenic sources including combustion engines, cigarettes, agricultural burning, and forest fires. Identifying the source of PM can inform effective mitigation strategies and policies, but this is difficult to do using current techniques. Here we present a method for identifying PM source using excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and a machine learning algorithm. We collected combustion generated PM2.5 from wood burning, diesel exhaust, and cigarettes using filters. Filters were weighted to determine mass concentration followed by extraction into cyclohexane and analysis by EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectra obtained from each source served as training data for a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for source identification in mixed samples. This method can predict the presence or absence of the three laboratory sources with an overall accuracy of 89% when the threshold for classifying a source as present is 1.1 $\mu$g/m3 in air over a 24-h sampling time. The limit of detection for cigarette, diesel and wood are 0.7, 2.6, 0.9 $\mu$g/m3, respectively, in air assuming a 24-h sampling time at an air sampling rate of 1.8 L per minute. We applied the CNN algorithm developed using the laboratory training data to a small set of field samples and found the algorithm was effective in some cases but would require a training data set containing more samples to be more broadly applicable.},

abstract = {A method is proposed for automatically determining the upper and lower boundaries of the Raman scatter peak in fluorescence spectroscopy from empirical data. Accurate peak boundaries are needed to calculate accurate Raman peak areas, used for normalizing fluorescence signals to produce data in units that are comparable between instruments. Comparisons of Raman peak boundaries across nine individual instruments (FluoroMax 3 (FM3) fluorometers from HORIBA Jobin Yvon and Cary Eclipse (CE) fluorometers from Varian Inc.) at the excitation wavelength $\lambda$ex = 350 nm reveal consistent results. At 350 nm excitation, the Raman peak was confined by the emission wavelengths of 382–418 nm, with boundaries determined for the FM3 fluorometers deviating by no more than 0.5 nm and 1.5 nm with respect to the start and end of the peak, and CE fluorometers deviating by up to 1.5 nm and 2 nm, respectively. Peak width was a function of fluorometer type and excitation wavelength. For the FM3 instruments, widths increased from approximately 30 nm at $\lambda$ex = 300 nm to 40 nm at $\lambda$ex = 380 nm, while for the CE instruments, peaks were approximately 5–8 nm narrower. Code for implementing the procedure in MATLAB, which allows for the adjustment of input parameters to compensate for noisy data, is provided in the Supplemental Material (available online).},

abstract = {The use of fluorescence data coupled with neural networks for improved predictability of drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs) was investigated. Novel application of autoencoders to process high-dimensional fluorescence data was related to common dimensionality reduction techniques of parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC) and principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed method was assessed based on component interpretability as well as for prediction of organic matter reactivity to formation of DBPs. Optimal prediction accuracies on a validation dataset were observed with an autoencoder-neural network approach or by utilizing the full spectrum without pre-processing. Latent representation by an autoencoder appeared to mitigate overfitting when compared to other methods. Although DBP prediction error was minimized by other pre-processing techniques, PARAFAC yielded interpretable components which resemble fluorescence expected from individual organic fluorophores. Through analysis of the network weights, fluorescence regions associated with DBP formation can be identified, representing a potential method to distinguish reactivity between fluorophore groupings. However, distinct results due to the applied dimensionality reduction approaches were observed, dictating a need for considering the role of data pre-processing in the interpretability of the results. In comparison to common organic measures currently used for DBP formation prediction, fluorescence was shown to improve prediction accuracies, with improvements to DBP prediction best realized when appropriate pre-processing and regression techniques were applied. The results of this study show promise for the potential application of neural networks to best utilize fluorescence EEM data for prediction of organic matter reactivity.},

abstract = {We studied the fluorescence properties of fulvic acids isolated from streams and rivers receiving predominantly terrestrial sources of organic material and from lakes with microbial sources of organic material. Microbially derived fulvic acids have fluorophores with a more sharply defined emission peak occurring at lower wavelengths than fluorophores in terrestrially derived fulvic acids. We show that the ratio of the emission intensity at a wavelength of 450 nm to that at 500 nm, obtained with an excitation of 370 nm, can serve as a simple index to distinguish sources of isolated aquatic fulvic acids. In our study, this index has a value of ∼1.9 for microbially derived fulvic acids and a value of∼1.4 for terrestrially derived fulvic acids. Fulvic acids isolated from four large rivers in the United States have fluorescence index values of 1.4-1.5, consistent with predominantly terrestrial sources. For fulvic acid samples isolated from a river, lakes, and groundwaters in a forested watershed, the fluorescence index varied in a manner suggesting different sources for the seepage and streamfed lakes. Furthermore, we identified these distinctive fluorophores in filtered whole water samples from lakes in a desert oasis in Antarctica and in filtered whole water samples collected during snowmelt from a Rocky Mountain stream. The fluorescence index measurement in filtered whole water samples in field studies may augment the interpretation of dissolved organic carbon sources for understanding carbon cycling in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The use of fluorescence spectrometry has been suggested as a simple method to determine the extent of natural organic matter humification by quantifying the red-shifting of fluorescence emission that occurs with' increasing humification. Humification indices are calculated by dividing fluorescence intensity at lorider Wavelengths by intensity at shorter wavelengths. These indices calculated without any specific efforts to standardize dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration will result in index values that vary with DOM concentration dueto fluorescence innerfiltering effects. This study critically evaluated the effect of DOM concentration on humification index determination using organic matter isolated from field corn extract, soil: water extract, and soil fulvic acid. The results show that humification index values are sensitive to DOM concentration of the solution and are linear with respect to transmittance of the solution at the 254 nm used as the excitation wavelength.'An approximate correction for DOM is to exploit the linear nature of the regression fit and to determine index values at the extrapolated 100% transmittance value. An exact correction using explicit correction factors for both primary and secondar innerfiltration effects was shownto give humification index values that are concentration invariant when absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was less than approximately 0.3 unit. Defining the humification, index as the fluorescence intensity in the 300→345 nm region divided by the sum of intensity in the 300→345 nm and 435→480 nm regions was statistically advantageous. This study suggests that for quantitative results which can be used to compare humification of natural organic matter across different studies, correction of the fluorescence emission spectra for innerfiltration effects is needed.},

The user can perform blank subtraction, dilution correction, Raman normalization, scatter removal and interpolation, and fluorescence normalization. The software performs parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation–emission matrices (EEMs), including peak picking of EEMs, and calculates fluorescence indices, absorbance indices, and absorbance slope indices from EEMs and absorbance spectra. A comparison between PARAFAC solutions by staRdom in R compared with drEEM in MATLAB showed nearly identical solutions for most datasets, although different convergence criteria are needed to obtain similar results and interpolation of missing data is important when working with staRdom.

abstract = {Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence has facilitated a surge of investigation into its biogeochemical cycling. However, rigorous, PARAFAC-based methods for holistically distinguishing DOM sources are lacking. This study classified 1029 PARAFAC-analyzed excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) measured using DOM isolated from 24 different leaf leachates, rivers, and organic matter standards using four machine learning methods (MLM). EEMs were also divided into subsets to assess the impact of experimental treatments (i.e. whole EEMs, size fractionation, mixtures, quenching) and dataset properties (i.e. different numbers of EEMs from each leachate/river) on classification. A split-half validated, 10-component PARAFAC model was extended to 12 components to remove consistent peaks evident in model residuals. The 12-component model performed better than the 10-component model, correctly classifying up to 80 additional EEMs, when the dataset included size-fractionated DOM or several different sources (i.e. many leaf species and rivers); however, the 10-component model performed better for whole-sample EEMs when comparing leaf leachates to rivers. The MLM correctly classified whole EEMs of riverine DOM by source with up to 87.0% accuracy, leachates with up to 92.5% accuracy, and distinguished leachates from rivers with 97.2% accuracy. A difference of up to 17.3% in classification accuracy was observed depending on the MLM method used with the following order: multilayer perceptron = support vector machine > k-nearest neighbours decision tree; however, performances differed widely depending on the data subset. Classification accuracy for whole and size-fractionated rivers compared to whole and size-fractionated leachates using N-way partial least-squares discriminant analysis (NPLS-DA; 97.7%) was similar to that achieved using MLM. Combining MLM with PARAFAC is an effective method for classifying DOM based on its fluorescence signature because PARAFAC can isolate meaningful fluorescent species and unlike PLSDA, MLM constructs a single model which simultaneously classifies EEMs as belonging to one of several categories. A complete accounting of carbon flows through ecosystems should include the processes and sources that contribute to the disparate fluorescence signatures of riverine and leached DOM.},

abstract = {The biochemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influences its biogeochemical role in freshwater ecosystems, yet DOM composition measurements are not routinely incorporated into ecological studies. To date, the majority of studies of freshwater ecosystems have relied on bulk analyses of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen to obtain information about DOM cycling. The problem with this approach is that the biogeochemical significance of DOM can only partially be elucidated using bulk analyses alone because bulk measures cannot detect most carbon and nitrogen transformations. Advances in fluorescence spectroscopy provide an alternative to traditional approaches for characterizing aquatic DOM, and allow for the rapid and precise characterization of DOM necessary to more comprehensively trace DOM dynamics. It is within this context that we discuss the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to provide a novel approach to tackling a longstanding problem: understanding the dynamics and biogeochemical role of DOM. We highlight the utility of fluorescence characterization of DOM and provide examples of the potential range of applications for incorporating DOM fluorescence into ecological studies in the hope that this rapidly evolving technique will further our understanding of the biogeochemical role of DOM in freshwater ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Fluorescence data of replicate samples obtained from different fluorescence spectrometers or by the same spectrometer but with different instrument settings can have great intensity differences. In order to compare such data an intensity calibration must be applied. Here we explain a simple calibration method for fluorescence intensity using only the integrated area of a water Raman peak. By applying this method to data from three different instruments, we show that it is possible to remove instrument-dependent intensity factors, and we present results on a unified scale of Raman units. The method presented is a rapid and simple approach suitable for routine measurements with no need for hazardous chemicals. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Applied Spectroscopy.},

@article{Ju2019,
abstract = {The fast identification and quantification of illicit drugs in biofluids are of great significance in clinical detection. However, existing drug detection strategies cannot fully meet clinical needs, and the on-site identification and quantification of various illicit drugs in biofluids remain a great challenge. Here, we report the development of a deep learning-assisted three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence difference spectroscopy for rapid identification and semiquantification of illicit drugs in biofluids. This strategy introduces highly fluorescent silver nanoclusters into the biofluids with illicit drugs as signal sources. The interaction between silver nanoclusters and drug molecules changed the fluorescence performance of the mixture. Deep learning methods were applied to grasp the subtle fingerprint information from the 3D fluorescence difference spectra to identify and semiquantify various illicit drugs in biofluids, including codeine, 4,5-methylene-dioxy amphetamine, 3,4-methylene dioxy methamphetamine, meperidine, and methcathinone. This approach can achieve a high prediction accuracy rate of 88.07% and a broad detection range from 2 $\mu$g/mL to 100 mg/mL. It opens up a new way for the detection of small molecules with or without fluorescence in complicated matrixes.},

abstract = {A sub-fraction of dissolved organic matter fluoresces when excited with ultraviolet light. This property is used to quantify and characterize changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic environments. Detailed mapping of the fluorescence properties of DOM produces excitation emission matrices (EEM), which are well suited to multi-way data analysis techniques (chemometrics). Techniques such as parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) are increasingly being applied to characterize DOM fluorescence properties. Here, an introduction to the technique and description of the advantages and pitfalls of its application to DOM fluorescence is presented. Additionally a MATLAB based tutorial and toolbox specific to PARAFAC analysis of DOM fluorescence is presented.},
